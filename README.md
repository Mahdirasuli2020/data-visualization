# Exploratory Data Analysis of Vancouver Trees

In this project, I will be using a subset of the Vancouver Street TreesLinks to an external site data set. It is a smaller data set with 5,000 rows. The subset of the original data from the City of Vancouver website was generated randomly so it may or may not be a representative sample of the original data set.
The primary goal of this project would be to maximize insight into the data set and uncover the underlying structure of the tree-related data.
